# Planning with tensor networks based on active inference

AI planning using matrix product states to model sequences and the action selection algorithm provided by active inference. A model-based approach to learning and planning i.e. the agentâ€™s generative model is a tensor network. Uses an update scheme which alternates between single-site and two-site updates, and allows dynamic variation of bond dimensions, while avoiding exploding bond dimensions as well as speeding up computation.
